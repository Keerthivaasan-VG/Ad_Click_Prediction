Ad Click Prediction is a machine learning process used to determine the likelihood that a user will click on an online advertisement. It analyzes user behavior, demographic information, device details, browsing history, and ad-related features such as ad type, placement, and timing.

By training models on historical ad interaction data, the system learns patterns that distinguish clicked ads from non-clicked ones. Common algorithms used include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

This prediction helps companies show relevant ads to the right users, improve click-through rate (CTR), reduce advertising costs, and maximize return on investment (ROI). Ad Click Prediction is widely used in digital marketing, social media platforms, search engines, and e-commerce websites to optimize ad performance and user experience.
